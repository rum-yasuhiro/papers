### 3.1. Abstruct
> They proposed a system of acoustic resonators coupled to superconducting circuits with a two-dimensional layout, and new magic state distillation protocol for Toffoli states for improving the fidelity of phsycal Toffoli gates in universal FTQC. They find realistic full-resource estimates of the physical error rates and overheads needed to run useful fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. 1000 superconducting, run circuits can't handle classical computer. 18000 qubits could estimate Hubbard model beyond reach of classical.

## 6. Data
- around 1000 superconducting circuit components, one could construct a fault-tolerant quantum computer that can run circuits, which are currently intractable for classical computers
- Hardware with 18 000 superconducting circuit components, in turn, could simulate the Hubbard model in a regime beyond the reach of classical computing
