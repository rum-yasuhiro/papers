## Key Ideas and one paragraph abstraction

Two versions of this protocol, 
- a 2-node protocol
- a more general multi-node protocol. Network
> benchmarking can be seen as an adaption of the randomized benchmarking protocol

### Abstruct
> We propose network benchmarking: a procedure to efficiently benchmark the quality of a quantum network link connecting quantum processors in a quantum network. This procedure is based on the standard randomized benchmarking protocol and provides an estimate for the fidelity of a quantum network link. We provide statistical analysis of the protocol as well as a simulated implementation inspired by NV-center systems using Netsquid, a special purpose simulator for noisy quantum networks.
