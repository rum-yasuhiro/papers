## Key Ideas and one paragraph abstraction

### Key Ideas
- This paper proposes a method of quantum Monte-Carlo integration that retains the full quadratic quantum advantage
- Without any arithmetic or the QFT to be performed on the quantum computer
- Fourier series decomposition of the sum that approximates the expectation in Monte-Carlo integration, with each component 
- Estimated individually using quantum amplitude estimation

### One paragraph abstraction

## Context
- Monte-Carlo integration (MCI)
- the quantum advantage in MCI is an advantage in query complexity: the number of uses of a quan- tum state that encodes the probability distribution in question will be fewer than the number of classical samples from that distribution â€“ but this immediately raises the question of how to prepare such a quantum state.
