## Key Ideas and one paragraph abstraction
- Using *cluster simulation scheme* based on flexible decomposition of tensor networks, 
  (K, d)-clustered quantum circuit on a d-qubit machine in time roughly $2^{O(K)}$
- The performance of this methods depends on *cluster parameters* of the given circuits
- Classical fragmentation methods and *Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics*(QM/MM) methods
- Hamiltonian simulation for patricular clustered quantum systems, and VQE.
